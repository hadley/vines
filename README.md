Implementation of the vine graphical model for building
high-dimensional probability distributions as a factorization of
bivariate copulas and marginal density functions. This package
provides S4 classes for vines (C-vines and D-vines) and methods for
inference, goodness-of-fit tests, density/distribution function
evaluation, and simulation.
