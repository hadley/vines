[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yasserglez/vines.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yasserglez/vines)

Implementation of the vine graphical model for building
high-dimensional distributions as a factorization of bivariate copulas
and marginal density functions. This package provides S4 classes for
vines (C-vines and D-vines) and methods for inference, goodness-of-fit
tests, density/distribution function evaluation, and simulation.
